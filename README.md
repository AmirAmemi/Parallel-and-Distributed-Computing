# 🖥️ Parallel and Distributed Computing

This repository contains various examples, algorithms, and projects focused on **parallel computing** and **distributed systems**. The projects explore different techniques to improve performance and scalability by utilizing multiple processors or distributed systems.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

The repository includes examples that demonstrate key concepts in parallel and distributed computing, such as:

- **Parallel Algorithms**: Techniques for breaking down tasks into smaller sub-tasks that can be executed concurrently.
- **Distributed Systems**: Architectures and strategies for managing systems that run on multiple machines.
- **Concurrency Models**: Exploring multi-threading, message-passing, and task parallelism.
- **MapReduce**: Implementing distributed computing frameworks for large-scale data processing.

Each project provides practical implementations of the theoretical concepts in parallel and distributed computing.
